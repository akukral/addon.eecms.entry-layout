# Entry Layout for ExpressionEngine

Showing empty and useless fields in your entries just because they come from the same channel ? Entry Layout will make them disappear ! Gone are the days when you had blank fields in specific entries in your channel. This can for example happen when trying to create static pages for a website, by setting up new channel and new custom fields, but you oftenly end up with many blank fields in the publish pages, and a lost client.

**Features**

With the Entry Layout ExpressionEngine addon, you can now tie a publish custom fields layout to an entry, giving you more flexibility to customize the ExpressionEngine Control Panel, resulting in an easy-to-admin website for your clients.

**Member Groups support**

Member Groups are supported in the Entry Field Add-On. This means that you will be able to have different layouts for each of your member groups for a specific entry.

**Multi Site Manager support**

Entry Layout support the Multi Site Manager ExpressionEngine feature.
